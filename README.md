## Description
In 2020 I started to focus more on web development and therefore created my portfolio website using Laravel/PHP and SCSS, later that year I grew more confident with TypeScript and JavaScript in generall so I've rewritten most of my JavaScript to TypeScript.

Early 2021 I grew more and more unsatisfied with my hosting provider and I felt comfortable enough with tech to do it myself. I got myself a VPS, read about hosting, headers and security. Setup my Webserver and now I needed a website to host.

Since I already changed my underlying structure why not change up my technology stack aswell. And here we are! Vuekyne, the Vue *remaster* of my PHP Project "darkyne.com". 

Faster, Cleaner, Prettier, Better.
